upgrade:
  - |
    Support for setting IPMI credentials during inspection was removed. This
    feature is not supported by ironic-inspector since the Pike release.
  - |
    The ``ipmi_address`` field is no longer sent as part of the inspection
    process. The ``inventory[bmc_address]`` field should be used instead.
