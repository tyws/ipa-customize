features:
  - CoreOS image builder now runs IPA in a chroot, instead
    of a container. systemd-nspawn has been adding more
    security features that break several things IPA needs
    to do (after all, IPA manipulates hardware), such as
    using sysrq triggers or writing to /sys.
upgrade:
  - Now that IPA runs in a chroot, any operator tooling
    built around the container may need to change (for
    example, methods of getting a shell inside the container).
