upgrade:
  - Ironic Python Agent no longer supports Ironic API lookup and heartbeat
    actions via agent vendor passthru methods,
    and uses only the new, top-level lookup and heartbeat endpoints of
    Ironic API v1.22 (introduced in Newton release, Ironic version 6.1.0).

    This effectively means that Ironic Python Agent becomes incompatible
    with Ironic API < 1.22 (Ironic version 6.0.0 or older,
    integrated OpenStack release Mitaka or older).
