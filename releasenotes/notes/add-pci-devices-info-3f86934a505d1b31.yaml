  - Adds new PCI devices collector named "pci_devices"
    to inspector module.
    Data is gathered from /sys/bus/pci/devices directory
    and is stored under "pci_devices" key as a dictionary
    containing "vendor_id" and "product_id" keys, which
    then will be used by the inspector to distinguish
    various PCI devices.
