fixes:
  - Stop using SYSRQ when performing the in-band reboot or power off
    because it has a similar effect to a hardware reset button/power
    switch and can be problematic on some hardware types. Instead,
    reboot/power off the node via the "poweroff" and "reboot" commands
    (soft power action).
