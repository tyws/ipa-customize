    Fixes bug where it was assumed that all BMCs operated on the default LAN
    channel. IPA now iterates through all the possible LAN channels for the
    IP address and returns 0.0.0.0 if the IPMI interface is not configured. See
    https://bugs.launchpad.net/ironic-python-agent/+bug/1702514
    for more details.
