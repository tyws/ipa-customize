    Fixes a bug in the LLDP discovery code that prevented reporting any
    LLDP information if an LLDP discovery raised an exception for one of the
    network interfaces. This could happen, for example, if a network
    interface incorrectly indicated its readiness for reading. See `bug 1665025
    <https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/1665025>`_ for details.
