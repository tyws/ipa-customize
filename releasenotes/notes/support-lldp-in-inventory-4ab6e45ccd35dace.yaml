features:
  - Add support for LLDP data in the returned inventory when option
    collect_lldp is set to True. Each interface returned in the inventory that
    receives an LLDP packet will contain the whole LLDP packet represented as a
    list of TLVs in the field 'lldp'.
upgrade:
  - Deprecated reserved fields switch_port_descr and switch_chassis_descr in
    favor of returning the whole LLDP packet for each interface so that IPA
    processing of this data remains generic and full processing can be
    customised server side instead of having to create custom ramdisks. These
    fields will be removed in Ocata.
