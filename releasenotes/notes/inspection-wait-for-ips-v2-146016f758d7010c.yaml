fixes:
  - During inspection wait only for a PXE booting NIC to get its IP by default.
    Introduce a new "inspection_dhcp_all_interfaces" option to enable waiting
    for all interfaces instead.
  - Stop checking the "has_carrier" field when waiting for NIC's to get IP
    addresses, as it might be set to "False" when the interface is being
    configured.
