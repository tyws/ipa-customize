    Collects the BIOS-given NIC's name and adds ``biosdevname`` field to the
    network interface inventory collected by the ``default`` collector of IPA.
    The utility ``biosdevname`` is used for this purpose.

    This feature is not available for Debian-based and CoreOS images as
    ``biosdevname`` is not packaged for Debian-based distributions.
issues:
  - Collection of the BIOS-given names of network interfaces is not possible on
    Debian-based images as the utility ``biosdevname`` is not available on
    them. This applies to any CoreOS images as well, as they utilize a
    Debian-based chroot.
