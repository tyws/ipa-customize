features:
  - The driver_internal_info internal setting
    ``agent_continue_if_ata_erase_failed`` allows operators
    to enable disk cleaning operations to fallback from a failed
    ata_erase operation to disk shredding operations.
fixes:
  - IPA will now attempt to unlock a security locked drive
    with a 'NULL' password if it is found to be enabled,
    however this will only work if the password was previously
    set to a 'NULL' value, such as if a failure during a previous
    ata_erase sequence.
  - Potential command failures in the secure erase process are
    now captured and raised as BlockDeviceEraseError exceptions.
