    Switched to ``lshw`` for memory configuration and system information collection
    when using the default hardware manager. This information can now be retrieved
    on both DMI capable and OpenFirmware capable systems. ``dmidecode`` is no longer
    used by the default hardware manager.

    and system information on OpenFirmware (PowerPC) capable systems, in addition
    to the already supported DMI (x86 and ARM) capable systems.

    ``lshw`` is now a dependency of the default hardware manager.
