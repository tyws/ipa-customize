features:
  - Ironic Python Agent can now access other services
    (Ironic, Inspector, image backend) when those are configured with
    HTTPS endpoints and use custom server certificates or require
    client certificates.
    It is possible to add a custom Certificate Authority (CA) file and client
    certificate files to the deploy ramdisk during build,
    and provide paths to those as corresponding new options
    in the ``ironic_python_agent.conf`` configuration file.
    Validation of the server certificate can be turned off with the
    ``insecure`` config option or via the ``ipa-insecure`` kernel boot
    parameter.
    This should make it possible to run IPA in CI-like environments that use
    HTTPS endpoints with self-signed certificates.
