features:
  - Adds support for streaming raw images directly onto
    the disk. This avoids writing the image to a tmpfs
    partition before writing it to disk, which also enables
    using images larger than the usable amount of RAM on
    the machine IPA runs on. Pass `stream_raw_images=True`
    to the `prepare_image` command to enable this; it is
    disabled by default.
fixes:
  - Raw images larger than available of RAM may now be used
    by passing `stream_raw_images=True` to the `prepare_image`
    command; these will be streamed directly to disk.
