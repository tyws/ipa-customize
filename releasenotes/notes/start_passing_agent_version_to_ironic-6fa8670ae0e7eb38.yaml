    Now passes an ``agent_version`` field to the Bare Metal service as part of
    the heartbeat request if the Bare Metal API version is 1.36 or higher.
    This provides the Bare Metal service with the information required to
    determine what agent features are available, so that the Bare Metal service
    can be upgraded to a new version before the agent is upgraded, whilst
    ensuring the Bare Metal service only requests the agent features that are
    available to it.
