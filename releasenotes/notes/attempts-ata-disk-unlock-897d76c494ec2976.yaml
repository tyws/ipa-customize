    Fixes the ATA Secure Erase logic to attempt an immediate unlock in the
    event of a failed attempt to Secure Erase. This is required to permit
    fallback to make use of the ``shred`` disk utility.

    In the event that an ATA Secure Erase operation fails during cleaning,
    the disk will be write locked. In this case, the disk must be explicitly
    unlocked.

    This should also prevent failures where an ATA Secure Erase operation
    fails with a pass-through disk controller, which may prevent the disk
    from being available after a reboot operation. For additional information,
    please see
