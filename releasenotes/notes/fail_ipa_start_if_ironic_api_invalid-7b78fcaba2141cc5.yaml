fixes:
  - Values of ``ipa-api-url`` specified in the configuration
    file that do not start with either ``https://`` or ``http://`` are no
    longer accepted.
    Such values lead to failure while contacting ironic-api.
    Such misconfigurations will be detected on ironic-python-agent start.
    An exception will be raised and an error about the invalid value
    will be logged.
